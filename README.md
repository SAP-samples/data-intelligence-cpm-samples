# SAP Data Intelligence Cloud CPM Samples

## Description
This repository contains files to accompany SAP Data Intelligence Cloud blog posts on the SAP Community. These files include graphs (pipelines) in JSON format, which can be imported into your Data Intelligence Cloud system, allowing you to follow along in your own system

## Requirements
These samples require access to an SAP Data Intelligence System. They are known to work on Data Intelligence Cloud version 2107 and have not been tested against SAP Data Intelligence for On-Premise.

## Download and Installation
The preferred way of importing the graph (pipeline) files into your Data Intelligence System is through the Modeler.

1. Along the left of the Modeler, switch to the Repository view
2. Create a folder to contain your graph by right clicking the "graphs" folder, selecting "New Folder" and providing a folder name
3. Import the graph file by right clicking your newly created folder, selecting "Import File" before selecting the graph .JSON file

**Note: In order for this file to be recognized as a graph, the file name must remain graph.json**
